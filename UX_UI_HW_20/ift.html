            <h2>The Informed Traveler</h2>
            <p>The Informed Traveler is a travel planning mobile app that allows travelers to plan a journey around
                locally-approved, authentic experiences. Travelers have the ability to write reviews about a location
                they have visited and read reviews left by other travelers and locals from the travel destination.</p>

        <div class="ift-problem">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>I observed that travelers were having trouble and spending too much time picking unique locations to
                visit for
                their travels. These locations tended to be overpriced and the same basic tourist experience recommended
                by
                almost every travelling website. How might I create a travel planning app so that travelers can easily
                and
                quickly find authentic experiences that fit within their budget and vacation time?</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="ift-solution">
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>Create The Informed Traveler, a travel planning experience, that allows the user to choose locations
                based on
                local and traveler reviews. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="ift-user">
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>I found 5 users that fit my requirements to be interviewed: people who had traveled and participated in
                creating travel plans at least once. My goals in interviewing these 5 people were to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Which methods did they enjoy using to plan their travels?</li>
                <li>What were the most frustrating parts of their travel planning processes?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Based on my findings in the diagram below, my interviewees expressed a need for visiting unique, local
                recommended places in order to avoid popular tourist attractions that were often over hyped.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">

            <h4>Persona: Miriam Garcia</h4>
            <p>I want you to meet Miriam Garcia, a sharp and highly individualistic traveler, who was born from the
                interviews. Miriam is sick of searching for unique travel destinations only to find overpriced tourist
                traps. It's time for her to find an authentic traveling experience.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="ift-ideation">
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>Our problem remains as stated under "The Problem" section. I began thinking of possible features to
                include in the traveling app by thinking of Miriam and what she would want to see in a travel app.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">

            <p>Since this is my first project and I only had so much time to work on this app, I prioritized which
                features I thought would be the most helpful to Miriam while still being easy to implement.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">

            <p>I envisioned the journey that Miriam would take through the app in the journey map below.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </div>

    


        <div class="ift-prototype">
            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
            <p>After several revisions, I finally translated Miriam's journey through the app in a user flow that would
                allow me to understand how to plan the layout of The Informed Traveler.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">

            <h4>Digital Wireframes</h4>
            <p>I quickly created digital wireframes of the paper sketches I had made of the app.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="ift-testing">
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <h4>Guerilla Testing</h4>
            <p>I tested my wireframes and evaluated what was working and not working for the app so far.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">

            <p>I concluded that users had trouble distinguishing local reviews from traveler reviews and that the filter
                button was not easily distinguishable.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">

            <p>I made iterations to the user flow based on these suggestions and proceded to make the final iOS
                prototype due to time constraints.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="ift-proto2">
            <h3>Prototyping Round 2</h3>
            <p>Finally, I created a clickable hi-fi prototype designed for iOS based on the feedback from Guerilla
                testing the low-fi prototype I had made.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="ift-results">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>My takeaway from this experience is to not get caught up in feature creep. I feel like I have spent a lot
                of time
                thinking about all the features that I could include in the app when I had already narrowed down that
                list based
                on feedback from user interviews and user testing. While making prototypes, I kept thinking of more
                features to
                place into the app, but I needed to focus more on the features prioritized.
                <br>
                For future projects, I will focus more on prioritized features. I will also try to remember to iterate
                as early
                and often as I can so that I do not get too caught up in one idea for a project.
